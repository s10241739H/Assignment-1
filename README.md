Wave to Earth Website

Wave to Earth is a band from South Korea that i enjoy listening to. I have noticed that they do not have a website for their band. I decided to make a webstie for them as they are lacking of fan interaction where they are able to achieve through a website. The website has 5 different pages, with index.html being the home page, tour.html as the Tour page where it will showcase upcoming tours or past. store.html as Store page, where it will show their merchandise. listen.html as Listen page, where it will showcase their albums, which unfortunately they only released one album. Lastly, about.html which is their About page, where it will showcase about the band.


Design Process

The website is not only for fans of Wave to Earth, but people who are trying to understand the band more. The website is designed for both fans and non fans of Wave to Earth. Fans usually would want to see the tours or the store of the band so that they can show their support for the band by buying things from the band. Not only that, they would also want to check out more about their bands by gaining knowledge about them. However, this website is also for non fans of Wave to Earth, where the website will show the "vibe" of the band. Wave to Earth is an indie rock genre band, where their music tends to be slow and melodic. The website captures the essence of the band simply from the design and the overall interactions of the website. This helps non fans to understand how the band is like before even listening to their music or discography. The website has plenty of links for the non fans to start supporting or listening to the band.

Technologies Used
https://www.w3schools.com/
Used for Social Media buttons in the footer


https://stackoverflow.com/
Used to find solutions of minor fixes in the code.




Testing

The Store page:
    1. Clicking on the images will not lead to anywhere as there is not leading page for each merch.

Tour page:
    1. As there not much concerts held by the band, there is only limited to 2 concerts that has already passed.

Album page:
    1. There is only one album done by the band.


When the page size is intefered, the layout of the design will change accordingly. Certain parts of the website will be overstretched or too small due to improper coding.

While doing the reveal animations, i couldn't get the animation to work on other pages, so i worked on another script and it worked.
